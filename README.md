# ChunkyMonkey
Authors: Nathan Tonani and Leland Burlingame

Chunky Monkey is a 2d desktop game built in C# using the .NET Framework. Similar to Helicopter, or Flappy Bird, the game is side-scrolling based. The player controls a monkey who is swinging on vines and collecting bananas while avoiding crocodiles and birds. The objective of the game is to collect as many bananas as possible. A timer is counting down, and the only way to add time is by collecting bananas. 

This game was created in our first year of programming and has not been refactor (KEEP IN MIND!).
