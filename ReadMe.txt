Welcome to Chunky Monkey!
Chunky Monkey is a 2d game revolving around a monkey trying to avoid obstacles and gather bananas to increase the time. There are two crocodiles and four birds you have to look out for, all the while a timer is counting down, forcing you to eat bananas which give back time. You are given 15 seconds to start and 5 seconds are added every time you eat a banana. Score is kept by bananas eaten. If you hit the walls, a bird, or a crocodile, you lose.
To Play:
When you load into the game, the monkey will be suspended waiting for you to start. Click the mouse button and the game will begin. Holding down the mouse button will cause the monkey to swing on the vine, while releasing will throw the monkey off. 
You can pause at any point by hovering over the far left side of the game, or clicking the 'p' hotkey. If you move your mouse to the left side of the game to pause, simply move the mouse back to the right and the game will resume. If you hit the 'p' hokey, you'll have to hit it again to resume.
You'll notice a small pause menu pops up when you pause the game. There are a few buttons on the menu. Mute/ummute, pause/play, readme, and exit. There is a song that is set to mute when you load in. Un-mute at any time to listen!
When you die, to play again, simply click the mouse button to be redirected to the beginning of the game. Click again, and the game begins. 
To exit, hit the exit button at the top right.
Hope you enjoy!
